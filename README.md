# Summer-of-Code
Approximate DCT Summer 2019
This folder contains Verilog HDL codes of a 2D DCT sytem for JPEG compression. DCT has 2 laters (DCT_app and DCT2_app) ,which are combined under dct_top.v. There are 16+16 = 32 adders in the project in total. These adders can be freely selected among the exact and approximate adders in the library: combined_apad_lib.v. The approximate adders are generated by ordering 4 approximate and 1 exact 1-bit adder in order to construct a ripple carry adder. These fundamental 1-bit adder blocks are given in apad_lib.v. 
In order to test the circuit, baboon, barbara, lena, and cameraman images are given as well as the test bench DCT_TOP_TEST.v. 
This project is originally developed on a Spartan3E (Xilinx XC3S500E) FGPA. A complete project folder with project settings is not provided here. Anyone can use the HDL codes for a similar platform. However, the area utilization and power consumption will be different for other FPGA's.
